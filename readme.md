Marketree is a web application aimed at helping network marketers (.e.g Avon Distributors) grow their businesses quicker, easier, and with a higher degree of predictability. The app allows users to create substantial amounts of "buzz" around thier chosen network marketing opportunity , before making a single investment. 

This gives users a predictable model, quicker ROI, team building autmation and illustrates their potential success. In turn users are able to mainly focus on personal sales. It does this in three steps:

1. Users invite their peers to a virtual event presenting a network marketing opportunity, via peronalised email invites. 

2. Users can build a virtual tree many levels deep of other users who are interested in the same oportunity as them. Once their 'Marketree' is big enough, the app will let them know the perfect time to sign up to their chosen opportunity. 

3. As their tree continues to grow, the app will then automatically sign up users from this tree into their actual business opportunity, as distributors.
